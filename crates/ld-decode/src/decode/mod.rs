//! The decoder driver (port of `LDdecode.readfield` / `decodefield` /
//! `buildmetadata` / `writeout` and friends from the Python ld-decode).
//!
//! The `Decoder` decodes a stream of f32 RF samples window by window. Each
//! call to [`Decoder::decode`] is one "readfield" pass: it locates the next
//! field, demodulates the needed blocks, runs the field-level sync/chroma
//! pipeline, computes VITS metrics and dropouts, applies automatic MTF/AGC
//! corrections (re-decoding once when they move the levels), and returns the
//! fields ready to write to the TBC output. When the supplied window does not
//! yet cover the next field and more input may still arrive, decoding pauses
//! with its state intact and reports the earliest sample offset still needed.

// Speculative EFM PLL
//
// The EFM PLL is the last serial step of a field (writeout), but its input is
// already fixed right after `process()`: the slice bounds come from `linelocs`
// and the state only changes at writeout. On the machines ld-decode runs on,
// the demod prefetch batch is still the binding constraint, so the ~1.2 ms the
// PLL costs on the serial tail can be spent on a helper thread during the
// ~9 ms of downscale+vits+metadata that precede writeout.
//
// Correctness rests on two ids:
//   * `token` — per-speculation, carried into the field's `WriteableField`, so
//     a speculative result can only ever be installed on the field it was
//     computed for (a backfill write of an older field has an older token).
//   * `gen` — bumped on *every* PLL state advance, so a result computed from a
//     state that a later writeout has already moved past is discarded.
// Anything that fails those checks falls back to the plain inline call, which
// is why the output cannot change: the commit path installs exactly the state
// the inline call would have produced.
