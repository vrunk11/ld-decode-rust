# name, which the caller passes as $1.

# Usage: bash .github/scripts/smoke.sh target/release/ld-decode[.exe]
#
# This is NOT the parity gate (that is b3sum 4/4 against the reference decodes,
# which needs the capture files and hours of runtime). It proves the binary
# starts, parses its arguments, runs the reader/no-signal/writer paths to
# completion through every output format, and exits cleanly.
